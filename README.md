# Essential Python Packages

## Pandas
- Pandas DataFrame returns a view by default when selecting a subset, meaning changes to the view will change the original.
- Pandas 2.0 offers the option to return a copy instead of a view by default, preventing changes to the copy from affecting the original.


# MLEM
The metadata of a machine learning model provides important information about the model such as:

✅ Hash value
✅ Model methods
✅ Input data schema
✅ Python requirements used to train the model.

This information enables others to reproduce the model and its results.

With MLEM, you can save both the model and its metadata in a single line of code.
